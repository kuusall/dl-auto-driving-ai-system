## üöó Swayatri: Deep Learning-Powered Autonomous Driving System

**Swayatri** is a collection of deep learning and computer vision-based modules designed to simulate and build core functionalities of an autonomous driving system. The project focuses on providing a reliable and intelligent framework for autonomous vehicle navigation through perception, planning, and control.

### üîç Objectives

The main goal of **Swayatri** is to explore and implement real-world autonomous vehicle concepts using modern AI and deep learning techniques. This system is broken into modular projects, each addressing a specific challenge faced by self-driving cars.

### üõ†Ô∏è Core Modules

1. **Lane Line Detection**

   * Detects simple lane lines from road images or video feed using classical computer vision techniques (Canny edge detection, Hough Transform).
   * Helps the vehicle understand the correct path and stay within the designated driving lanes.

2. **Advanced Lane Finding**

   * Uses deep learning and advanced CV to identify:

     * Curved lane lines
     * Lane boundary types (dashed, solid, etc.)
     * Other vehicles and obstacles
   * Involves semantic segmentation and object detection models.

3. **Traffic Sign Classification**

   * Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify road signs (stop, speed limit, yield, etc.).
   * Trained on datasets like German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB).

4. **Behavioral Cloning**

   * Mimics human driving behavior using a neural network trained on driver video footage and corresponding steering/brake inputs.
   * Predicts steering angle and brake/throttle values from raw camera input.

5. **Extended Kalman Filters**

   * Implements EKFs to fuse noisy sensor data (like GPS and IMU) and track the vehicle's position more accurately.
   * Used for state estimation in a dynamic environment.

### üöÄ Advanced Modules

1. **Localization using the Kidnapped Vehicle Problem**

   * Solves the problem of determining the vehicle‚Äôs position on a map even after starting in an unknown location.
   * Uses probabilistic methods such as Particle Filters or Monte Carlo Localization (MCL).

2. **Path Planning**

   * Determines the optimal trajectory from the vehicle‚Äôs current location to a target location while avoiding obstacles.
   * Implements techniques like A\*, Dijkstra, and spline-based trajectory generation.

3. **PID Control**

   * Implements Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers for:

     * Steering correction
     * Speed control
   * Ensures smooth and stable driving by reducing error between desired and actual vehicle states.
